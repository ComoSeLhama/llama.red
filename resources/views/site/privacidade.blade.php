<b>Our Policy</b> <br>
Welcome to Vanido. (“Vanido”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) has been created to provide information about our mobile game application (the “Services”) to our users (“you”, “your”). The Services are provided by Vanido. This Privacy Policy sets forth Vanido’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to our website located at vanido.io (the “Site”) and users of the Services.
<br>
Information we collect<br>
When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
  <br>
  <br>

Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to the Services (for example email address, first name, and last name), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries, or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever Vanido collects Personal Data, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
<br>

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Vanido and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
<br>

Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data: When you interact with Vanido through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable data. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Vanido may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Vanido affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Site or game of our apps, the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Vanido Services.
<br>

Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Vanido often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Vanido may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Vanido may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
<br>

In operating the Services, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser or device that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services features.
<br>
Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information
Vanido uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Vanido and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable data collected through the Services to help us customize the Services or the messages you receive, improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. Vanido and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, any marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications.
<br>

If Vanido intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
<br>
<br>
Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information
Vanido is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

<br>
Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
<br>
Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

<br>
Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Vanido, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
<br>

Legal Requirements: Vanido may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Elevate, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
<br>
Your Choices<br>
You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. Our mobile app, however, requires users to provide Personal Data, specifically email address, in order to access the entirety of that app’s functionality. You may request that we delete your account, and any information associated with your account, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to retain certain information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete your information, it will be deleted from the active database but may remain in our archives.
<br>
Children<br>
We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act), we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.

<br>
<br>
Links to Other Web Sites: This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Vanido (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Vanido endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
<br>
Integrating Third Party Services within the Services<br>
One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable various online third party services, such as social media and networking services, (“Third Party Services”) to be directly integrated into your Vanido experience. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to provide us your username and password for the relevant Third Party Services. By enabling such Third Party Services, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information to these service providers for this purpose. When you add a Third Party Service account to the Service, we will collect your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service. However, please remember that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and Vanido shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Service that may be enabled within the Service.
<br>

Security: Vanido takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.
<br>
Other Terms and Conditions: Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Service.
<br>
Changes to Vanido’s Privacy Policy: The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Vanido to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Vanido reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
